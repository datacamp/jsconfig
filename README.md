# JSConfig

This repo provides a set of npm packages that configure the awesome tooling we use every day. There are a lot of these standards out there, but as a company we have specific needs, so this is here to serve us in the best way.

Also, when you have too many standards, xkcd recommends to create a new standard ([Source](https://xkcd.com/927/)).

## Vision

By having a vision, we can make some decisions more easily by refering back to this vision and how a change contributes to this vision.

The goal of JS Config is to improve the productivity of our developers (in the long term). This means we should strive for (in order of importance):

1. _Consistency_: auto-formatting / auto-sorting stuff: Developers should not need to think about this stuff and still find their code in a readable and consistent order / syntax. There shouldn't be a lot of discussion about which style to pick as it's just a matter of taste and getting used too. Let's try to stay as close as possible to "community standards".
1. _Correctness_: small bugs (e.g. eslint rules about hooks) should be catched by eslint not by (human) reviews. Rules that catch potential bugs and with few false positives should be enabled.
1. _Code Quality_: Rules that help in code quality and are not flagging too many false positives could be enabled as well.
1. _Unity_: Having as many configs as possible in this repo and use it in as many projects as possible with at little adaptation as possible (but adaptation is still allowed!). That way engineers can assume a good and working setup and donâ€™t need to catch little bugs during review time if a linter can do this.

## Installation :floppy_disk:

(If you are using npm, you should use `npm install` instead of `yarn add`)

### ESlint :wrench:

```bash
yarn add -D eslint @datacamp/eslint-config
```

Create a file `.eslintrc.js` with the following contents

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@datacamp/eslint-config'],
};
```

For typescript projects you can use the following config:

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@datacamp/eslint-config/typescript'],
};
```

For front-end projects, you might want to adjust the environment:

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  // [...]
  env: {
    browser: true,
  },
};
```

Afterwards you can run eslint as follows:

```bash
yarn eslint . --ext ts,js,json --ignore-path .gitignore
```

It's recommended to:

- also install our common prettier config (as ESlint config uses your prettier config to lint for code style)
- install an eslint plugin for your editor of choice (to see errors / warnings in your editor)

### Prettier :nail_care:

```bash
yarn add -D prettier @datacamp/prettier-config
```

Create a file `prettier.config.js` with the following contents

```js
// prettier.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...require('@datacamp/prettier-config'),
};
```

It's recommended to:

- also install eslint to check whether your files are following your prettier config.
- install prettier plugin for your editor of choice

## Contribute :family:

### Developer guide

All the configs are in the `packages/` directory. We use [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage dependencies.

Install the dependencies for all the subpackages using `yarn` in the root of the project.

If you need help, ping the #javascript channel on Slack.

### Decisions process :hocho:

1. Try out the configuration in your own project for a while (so the cost / benefit trade-off becomes more apparent)
1. Create a PR (or an issue with a proposal if the PR would be a lot of work) outlying the changes + why it's a good idea. You can refer to the vision on what level it improves developer productivity (Consistency, Correctness, Code Quality, Unity).
1. Communicate proposal in #javascript channel on Slack
1. On the next javascript guild meeting, we go over all open PRs and quickly discuss as a group on whether we think it's a good idea. For this, we base ourselves on the vision. A change that fits the vision well has a higher chance of getting merged.

### Publishing

You can publish all the packages you've edited. This will run `lerna publish` under the hood:

```bash
yarn release
```

This will propose version numbers for you and push a commit with a changelog to all the individual packages.

_Please only run this from master and make sure to pull the latest master before you run it._ Running it will push a commit to master which the updated changelog etc.
